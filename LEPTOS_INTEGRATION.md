# Leptos Frontend Integration Process

## Overview
This document describes the process of integrating a Leptos WebAssembly frontend into the fitness advisor AI project, starting from branch creation through successful compilation.

## Branch Strategy
- **Source**: `react-frontend-integration` (contained mixed React + Leptos code)
- **Target**: `leptos-frontend-wip` (dedicated Leptos-only branch)
- **Goal**: Clean separation between React and Leptos implementations

## Step 1: Branch Creation
Created `leptos-frontend-wip` branch from the existing mixed-content branch to isolate Leptos development.

## Step 2: Figma Make Code Integration
- **Source**: `/home/trmonchi/Downloads/Fitness_Advisor_AI_rust.zip`
- **Content**: Figma Make generated Rust/Leptos UI components
- **Target**: Replace manual Leptos 0.7 attempt with proper Figma Make generated Leptos 0.6 code

### Key Components Integrated:
- `src/main.rs` - Main Leptos application entry point
- `src/components/` - Complete UI component library:
  - `stats_cards.rs` - Fitness metrics dashboard cards
  - `workout_panel.rs` - Real-time workout tracking with camera feed
  - `menu_optimization.rs` - Genetic algorithm meal planning interface
  - `progress_charts.rs` - Analytics and progress visualization
  - `quick_actions.rs` - Interactive action buttons
  - `navigation.rs` - App navigation header
  - `icons.rs` - SVG icon components

## Step 3: Leptos Version Migration (0.6 â†’ 0.7)
### Initial Attempt: Leptos 0.6
- Used Figma Make generated code with Leptos 0.6
- Encountered nightly Rust requirements
- Build failed due to stable Rust toolchain

### Migration to Leptos 0.7
- Updated `Cargo.toml` dependencies from 0.6 to 0.7
- Removed `nightly` features for stable Rust compatibility

### Import System Updates
Changed from wildcard imports to prelude:
```rust
// Before (0.6)
use leptos::*;

// After (0.7)
use leptos::prelude::*;
use leptos_meta::*;
use leptos::mount::mount_to_body;
```

### Signal API Migration
Updated signal creation and usage:
```rust
// Before (0.6)
let (state, set_state) = create_signal(value);
{move || state()}  // Function call syntax

// After (0.7)
let (state, set_state) = signal(value);  // Deprecated create_signal
{move || state.get()}  // Method call syntax
set_state.set(new_value);  // Method call for setters
```

### Component Type System Updates
Updated component interfaces:
```rust
// Before (0.6)
icon: View,

// After (0.7)
icon: impl IntoView,
```

### Conditional Rendering Fixes
Replaced manual conditional logic with `Show` component:
```rust
// Before - Type mismatch issues
{move || if condition() { view! { ... } } else { view! { ... } }}

// After - Using Show component
<Show when=move || condition.get()>
    <div>...</div>
</Show>
```

## Step 4: Build Configuration
### Library Setup
- Created `src/lib.rs` to expose Leptos frontend as library
- Updated `Cargo.toml` with proper lib configuration:
  ```toml
  [lib]
  name = "fitness_advisor_ai"
  path = "src/lib.rs"
  crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
  ```

### Features Configuration
- Simplified hydrate feature for Leptos 0.7:
  ```toml
  [features]
  hydrate = ["leptos/hydrate"]
  ```

### WebAssembly Dependencies
Core WASM dependencies maintained:
- `wasm-bindgen = "0.2"`
- `web-sys = "0.3"`
- `console_error_panic_hook = "0.1"`

## Step 5: Final Build Status
### Successful Library Compilation
- Leptos frontend library builds successfully with warnings only
- All component dependencies resolved
- Signal API working correctly with 0.7 syntax
- WebAssembly target ready for compilation

### Remaining Items
- Backend binary path needs adjustment (expected for frontend-only build)
- Dead code warnings in progress charts (expected for initial implementation)

## Component Architecture
### Main Application (`src/lib.rs`)
- Root `App` component with meta context
- Gradient background with visual effects
- Modular component composition

### UI Components
1. **Navigation** - App header with branding
2. **StatsCards** - BMI, energy, fitness level metrics
3. **WorkoutPanel** - Real-time form analysis with camera integration
4. **MenuOptimization** - Genetic algorithm controls with reactive sliders
5. **ProgressCharts** - Weight, workout, and strength analytics
6. **QuickActions** - Interactive buttons with feedback messages

### Technical Features
- Reactive signal-based state management
- WebAssembly compilation ready
- Tailwind CSS styling with gradient effects
- Component-based architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Type-safe interfaces with Rust's type system

## Build Commands
```bash
# Library only (frontend)
cargo build --lib --features hydrate

# Full WebAssembly build (when trunk is configured)
trunk build --features hydrate
```

## Next Steps
1. Configure Trunk bundler for WebAssembly compilation
2. Set up development server for Leptos frontend
3. Integrate with existing Rust backend API endpoints
4. Test real-time WebSocket connections for workout tracking
5. Implement proper data fetching from backend services
